# lora_finetuning
This repository demonstrates efficient fine-tuning of large language models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). It includes scripts and configurations for dataset preparation, training, evaluation, and inference â€” enabling quick adaptation of pretrained models to custom downstream tasks with minimal compute.
