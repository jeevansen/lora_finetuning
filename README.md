# lora_finetuning
This repository demonstrates efficient fine-tuning of large language models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). It includes scripts and configurations for dataset preparation, training, evaluation, and inference — enabling quick adaptation of pretrained models to custom downstream tasks with minimal compute.
Features:

 LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning

 Support for Hugging Face Transformers

 Training and validation pipeline with custom datasets

 Fast and memory-efficient implementation

 Example notebooks for instruction and conversational tuning

Use Cases:
Text classification • Instruction tuning • Chatbot adaptation • Domain-specific language modeling
